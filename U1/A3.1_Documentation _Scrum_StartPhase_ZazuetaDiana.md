|Acosta Noriega Saul Eduardo |These diagrams will help us a lot when programming since then we will already have a notion of what to do.
|Garza Aguilar Sergio Alberto| The elaboration of these diagrams has clarified the opportunities and accesses that each role will have within the system, showing an exploration of the different paths that they will have to take, as a visual support it is possible to make the structure of the platform known and the accesses that each one will have in case of wanting to carry out a certain action, it is important that it must be clear and understandable for those who do not have a technical language or previous knowledge, as developers it is also a support tool to focus the same vision of the platform .
|HernaÃÅndez FernaÃÅndez Diana  |The practice helped us to make the necessary diagrams of which with the past tasks we had knowledge of the elements that each one must carry and that will be of great help during the development of the platform according to the case study "Courses and certifications" .
|Zazueta Lopez Diana | This work helped me to better understand how the system will work in more detail our case study of courses and certifications, but it also made it difficult for me to know how some diagrams were made, but by watching some videos and reading, I clarified my doubts.  These diagrams are extremely important as they will later help us to carry out the development of this program.
